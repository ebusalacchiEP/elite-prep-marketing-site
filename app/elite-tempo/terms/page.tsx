            These Terms of Use (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your use of the Elite
            Tempo app published by Elite Prep LLC (&quot;Elite Prep,&quot;
            &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us&quot;). By downloading or using the app, you
            agree to these Terms. If you don&apos;t agree, don&apos;t use the app.

          <Section title="1. The app & your license">
            <p>
              Elite Tempo is a golf tempo and timing trainer: it plays the
              hand-timed tempo of real, notable golf swings and lets you time and
              review your own swings. We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
              revocable license to use the app for your own non-commercial use,
              subject to these Terms and Apple&apos;s rules.

          <Section title="2. Purchases (one-time unlock)">
            <p>
              The full library and the Time Your Swing feature are unlocked by a
              one-time, non-consumable in-app purchase (&quot;Unlock Elite
              Tempo&quot;). There is no subscription. All payments are processed by
              Apple through your Apple ID; we do not handle your payment
              information. Restoring a previous purchase on a new device is
              supported in Settings. Refunds are handled by Apple under the App
              Store terms; we cannot directly issue App Store refunds.

          <Section title="3. Your content (swing videos)">
            <p>
              Swing videos you record or import, and the timings you create, are
              yours. They are stored on your device (see the Privacy Policy); we do
              not receive or host them. You are solely responsible for the content
              you capture and for having the right to record any person in your
              videos. Don&apos;t capture or use content that is unlawful or
              infringes someone else&apos;s rights.
