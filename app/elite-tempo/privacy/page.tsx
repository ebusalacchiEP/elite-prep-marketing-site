                Elite Tempo Pro, whether the one-time lifetime unlock or the yearly
                subscription, is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We
                never see your payment-card details. Apple provides only an anonymized

                to any server. Videos you record in the app are also saved to your
                device&apos;s Photos library, with your permission, so you keep the
                footage.
